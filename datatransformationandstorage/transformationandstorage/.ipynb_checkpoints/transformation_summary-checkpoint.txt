=== Transformation Logic Applied ===
- Created AgeGroup from Age (bins: <25, 25-40, 40-60, >60).
- Created BalanceSalaryRatio = Balance / (EstimatedSalary + 1).
- Created CreditScoreBucket from CreditScore (Low <500, Medium 500-700, High >700).

=== Sample SQL Queries ===
1. SELECT * FROM transformed_churn LIMIT 10;
2. SELECT AgeGroup, COUNT(*) AS Customers FROM transformed_churn GROUP BY AgeGroup;
3. SELECT CreditScoreBucket, AVG(BalanceSalaryRatio) FROM transformed_churn GROUP BY CreditScoreBucket;
4. SELECT IsActiveMember, AVG(CreditScore) FROM transformed_churn GROUP BY IsActiveMember;
5. SELECT Geography, SUM(Exited) AS Churned_Customers FROM transformed_churn GROUP BY Geography;
